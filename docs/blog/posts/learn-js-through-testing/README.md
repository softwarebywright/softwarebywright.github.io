# Learn JavaScript Through Testing

Welcome to the `Learn JavaScript Through Testing` tutorials, where we do just that learn the language through testing. As we work our way through the language we will prove how each piece works. If you have any questions feel free to contact me directly at [contact@softwarebywright.com](mailto:contact@softwarebywright.com) or leave comments in the posts.
