Welcome to the `Learn JavaScript Through Testing` tutorials, where we do just that learn the language through testing. As we work our way through the language we will prove how each piece works. If you have any questions feel free to contact me directly at [contact@softwarebywright.com](mailto:contact@softwarebywright.com) or leave comments in the posts.

If you are interested in the up coming articles check out the Trello board [here](https://trello.com/b/RoF5f9x6/learn-javascript-through-unit-testing). If you have any suggestions or topics that you would like to see in this topic please leave a comment below.
