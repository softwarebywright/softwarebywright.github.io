Welcome to the `Learn JavaScript Through Testing` series, where we do just that learn the JavaScript language through testing. As we learn about JavaScript we will prove how each piece works through testing. If you have any questions feel free to contact me directly at [contact@softwarebywright.com](mailto:contact@softwarebywright.com) or leave comments in the posts.

If you are interested in the up coming articles check out the Trello board [here](https://trello.com/b/RoF5f9x6/learn-javascript-through-unit-testing). If you have any suggestions or topics that you would like to see in this topic please leave a comment below.
