Welcome back to the series, today we will be working through JavaScript `{{$page.frontmatter.subject}}`.

::: tip
Be sure to check out the first part of the series [here](/blog/posts/learn-js-through-testing/00-getting-started.html) for project set up, or download the project template [here](https://github.com/softwarewright/learn-js-thru-testing/archive/variables.zip). Run `npm install` inside of the project folder to get started if you download it.
:::

**Before getting started be sure to create a `{{$page.frontmatter.specFile}}` file in your project directory. This is where we will put all of the new `Test Cases`.**
